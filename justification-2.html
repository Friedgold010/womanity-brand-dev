                  <p> A remote user testing study was performed, with the goal of evaluating the usability of our WOMANITY brand website.  
                      
                      Three users were asked to perform some tasks on our website and see if they ran into some problems, and if they had any feedback. We summarized all their answers and listed some of their quotes to make a clear overview of what could be improved on our website.  
                      
                      
                      
                      Participants:&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;Jasmijn Niezen, 20&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;Kelsey ten Broek, 18&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;Richard Vanhouten, 51</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row justify-content-center">
                <div class="col-10">
                    <p> <strong> Task 1 “What is the website about? What do they offer?”</strong>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>What worked To all our participants it was clear that it was a website about feminism and equality Kelsey: “The colors of the website match the message of the website which I like</p>
                  <p>” Richard: “There is no questioning that this website is about feminism.” What did not work 1/3 participants found it clear what WOMANITY offers or what they sell. The home page did have a clear message on what the brand stands for. However, 2/3 of our participants could not tell what we offer.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;Jasmijn: “I think they offer workshops, because that is what I see at the top of the page</p>
                  <p>” Kelsey” “From just looking at the homepage, I don’t know what this company offers” Improvement points Make it clearer that we offer workshops at our homepage&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><strong>Task 2 “Imagine if you were looking for workshop “feminist history” How would you find it?</strong></p>
                  <p>” What worked 3/3 participants knew how to find the FEMINIST HISTORY workshop.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Jasmijn: "In the bar I would click on WORKSHOPS, then I would look and scroll down to “FEMINIST HISTORY.” It is not hard to find the workshop. What did not work Some participants wanted to click on the workshops to see if they could receive more information.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;Richard: “I could not click on the workshop to see more information or to sign up, the only thing I can do right now is to sign in a form, I think this takes a lot of time. A better idea is to click on the workshop you want and to see more information.” Key points Improve the website by making the workshops clickable.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><strong>Task 3 “Please book an appointment for this workshop”</strong>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>What worked: finding the page where you can book a workshop easily. knowing what workshop where available and what they were about.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;Kelsey: she clicked on the right page (workshops) right away and read the different available workshops&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Jasmijn: looked at all the options for the pages to click, then she clicked on the workshop page</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;Richard: looked for a booking page at first but when he did not see one, he clicked on workshops&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>What did not work:</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;it took a second for the participants to realize they had to scroll down to make an appointment and that they should not click on the workshop description.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;Kelsey: she clicked on the workshop she wanted to do, when there was no response, she clicks a couple more times. Then she scrolled down and found the field where you can sign up.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Jasmijn: looked for a book bottom to sign in close to the workshop, then she clicked on the workshop, when that did not work, she scrolled down to find the sign-up form.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;Richard: was looking at all the workshops. When he was scrolling down to see them all he saw the sign-up form and started to fill it in.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Improvement points: Make it clearer that the sign-up form is at the bottom of the page. maybe have a line at the description of the workshop that says, sign up below.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;<strong>Task 4 “Please go to our TikTok and Instagram account”</strong></p>
                 <p>&nbsp;What worked The links to the TikTok and Instagram page works perfectly.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Kelsey: “When I clicked on the logo’s, I got to see what I was looking for.” What did not work When you make the page smaller, the bar disappears.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Jasmijn: “I made the bar smaller and then the logos disappeared out of the page.” Improvement points: We need to look at the navbar, because when you make it smaller, the TikTok and Instagram logos disappear. </p>

                  <p>&nbsp;The user testing was done via Microsoft teams. We sent the link to the published site to our participants and let them do the task&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;that are mentioned above. During the tasks we took notes and listened to their feedback. Due to privacy reasons some of our&nbsp; &nbsp;participants preferred not to be recorded. &nbsp;</p>
